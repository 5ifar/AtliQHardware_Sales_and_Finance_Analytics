This repository serves as my documentation for the AtliQ Hardwares Sales & Finance Analytics Excel Project.
It was created as a self-learning project for the course: [Excel: Mother of Business Intelligence](https://codebasics.io/courses/excel-mother-of-business-intelligence) by [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/).

It showcases my competancy to work with Microsoft Excel and demonstrates my proficiency in essential Excel concepts like ETL with Power Query, Data Modelling, VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH/XLOOKUP Table Joining, Pivot Table, Power Pivot, DAX Measures, Conditional Formating etc.

The entire project has been implemented using Microsoft Excel 2016.
