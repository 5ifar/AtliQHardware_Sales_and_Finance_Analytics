This repository serves as my documentation for the AtliQ Hardware Sales & Finance Analytics Excel Project.
It was created as a self-learning project for the course: [Excel: Mother of Business Intelligence](https://codebasics.io/courses/excel-mother-of-business-intelligence) by [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/).

It showcases my competancy to work with Microsoft Excel and demonstrates my proficiency in essential Excel concepts like ETL with Power Query, Data Modelling, VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH/XLOOKUP Table Joining, Pivot Table, Power Pivot, DAX Measures, Conditional Formating etc.

The entire project has been implemented using Microsoft Excel 2016.

The project files have not been uploaded to this repository in compliance with Codebasics Data & Content Distribution Policy.
